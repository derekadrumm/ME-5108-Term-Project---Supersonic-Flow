# ME-5108 Numerical Fluid Dynamics Term Project
This is my final report and corresponding code from my Numerical Fluid Dynamics course which I took in spring 2022.

The project involved building a MATLAB code which solved a supersonic flow past a flat plate using MacCormack's method. Its from a few years ago, I have since switched my code formatting style. But it was a fun projct, and I was quite happy with how the report turned out.
